# 2D Particle Simulation: Space Traffic

## https://youtu.be/O-JVuuiDYMk

The simulation started with just black and white...

With varying parameters came different phenomenons...

Then came color based on traveling direction (i.e. radian angle)...
## ![plot](./screenshots/s3.png)
Varying hyperparameters made new patterns...
## ![plot](./screenshots/s4.png)
More distilled parameters were closer to the final shape...

The final look, simulating 2^27 particles at 60fps...

* *What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?*
    * The most challenging and interesting part of the project was figuring everything out by myself and moving all computations to compute shaders. This was especially hard because ModernGL is a relatively sparsely covered python package and there are only very few examples of implementations online. I would have wished for more office hours per week though in the end, I did not really need them.
